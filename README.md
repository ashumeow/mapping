<br>
It makes use of in-built Javascript frameworks such as <a href="https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet">Leaflet</a> and <a href="https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7">Framework7</a>. <br>
When it comes to Javascript APIs for interaction, then it makes use of <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_geolocation.asp">HTML5 GeoLocation API</a> (works only when online) for GPS purpose and <a href="https://github.com/mapbox/leaflet-pip">Leaflet-pip</a>.<br>
For HTTP requests such as GET and POST, then it makes use of <a href="https://github.com/alotaiba/FlyJSONP">FlyJSONP</a>.<br>
For plotting coordinates of latitudes/longitudes, the points were fetched from <a href="https://maps.google.com/">Google Maps</a>.<br>
